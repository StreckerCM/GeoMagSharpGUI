 * File:            DataModel.cs
 * Description:     Legacy compatibility file - classes have been reorganized
 *                  into the Models folder structure for better maintainability.
 * Author:          Christopher Strecker
 * Website:         https://github.com/StreckerCM/GeoMagSharpGUI

 * NOTE: This file is retained for backward compatibility reference only.
 *       All classes are now defined in their own files under:
 *       - Enums/GeoMagEnums.cs (CoordinateSystem, Algorithm, etc.)
 *       - GeoConstants.cs (Constants class)
 *       - Models/Coordinates/ (Coordinate, Latitude, Longitude)
 *       - Models/Configuration/ (Preferences, CalculationOptions)
 *       - Models/Magnetic/ (MagneticModelSet, MagneticModel, etc.)
 *       - Models/Results/ (MagneticCalculations, MagneticValue, GeoMagVector)
 *
 *       The namespace remains GeoMagSharp for full backward compatibility.

// This file is intentionally empty.

// in the Models, Enums, and GeoConstants folders.
// The GeoMagSharp namespace is preserved so no code changes are needed.
